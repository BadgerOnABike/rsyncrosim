## About SyncroSim

- **Automatically structure your data:**
SyncroSim ties together your existing data from disparate formats, such as Excel, CSV, and GeoTIFF. No database is required – SyncroSim automatically structures your data files for you.

- **Use your data to make predictions:**
SyncroSim allows you to chain together “models” – including existing off-the-shelf programs and scripts written in languages such as R, Python and C# – to transform your data into predictions.

- **Engage decision makers:**
No longer are forecasts delivered by analysts as static reports. Through its unique, easy-to-use interface, SyncroSim allows non-technical users to define, run and track their own “what-if” scenarios using the original data and models.

- **Go big:**
SyncroSim is specifically designed to handle big data, including support for cloud computing, multiprocessing, and large rasters.
